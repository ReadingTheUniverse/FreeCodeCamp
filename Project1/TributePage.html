	<p>Grandmaster Helio Gracie, co-founder and father of the most effective martial art in the world.  He was a frail and weak young man who couldn't adequately compete against most martial artists.  He was determined to become a fighter and discovered ways to mitigate his weaknesses.  He focused on his strengths:  his small stature, faster movements against larger opponents, and strong will.  Helio found that focusing on techniques that nullified his opponents strengths were key.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Helio focused on the ground fighting aspect of Judo.  An often neglected part of the art, shadowed by it's judoka's interests in throws and stand up grappling techniques.  His opponents did not know how to defend against his attacks.  He would grow up to challenge professional fighters using his newly devoloped art.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>His children grew up to be ambassadors for the art.  One would become the founder of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Many grew to be champions within the art, vale tudo, and other prestigious fighting competitions.  His descendents have inspired the world and forever changed the martial arts.  All this from a frail young boy with a phenomenal fighting spirit.  What a legacy!</p>
